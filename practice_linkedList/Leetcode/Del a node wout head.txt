=>A node will be given , we have to delete that node 
Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.

It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]

->we have to shift that node value to last and we delete last node

code:-
 public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        ListNode cur=node;
        ListNode prev=null;
        while(cur.next!=null)
        {
             prev=cur;
            int temp=cur.val;
            cur.val=cur.next.val;
            cur.next.val=temp;
            cur=cur.next;
        }
        prev.next=null;
        
        
    }
